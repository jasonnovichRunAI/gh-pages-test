# (Optional) Customize Cluster Installation

The Run:ai cluster creation wizard requires the download of a _Helm values file_ `runai-<cluster-name>.yaml`. The file may be edited to customize the cluster installation.


## Configuration Flags

|  Key     |  Default  | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------| 
| `runai-operator.config.project-controller.createNamespaces` | `true` | Set to `false`if unwilling to provide Run:ai the ability to create namespaces. When set to false, will requires an additional manual step when creating new Run:ai Projects | 
| `runai-operator.config.project-controller.clusterWideSecret` | `true` | Set to `false` when using PodSecurityPolicy or OpenShift | 
| `runai-operator.config.mps-server.enabled` | `false` | Set to `true` to allow the use of __NVIDIA MPS__. MPS is useful with _Inference_ workloads  | 
| `runai-operator.config.global.runtime` | `docker` | Defines the container runtime of the cluster (supports `docker` and `containerd`). Set to `containerd` when using Tanzu | 
| `runai-operator.config.global.nvidiaDcgmExporter.namespace` | `gpu-operator` | The namespace where dcgm-exporter (or gpu-operator) was installed |
| `runai-operator.config.global.nvidiaDcgmExporter.installedFromGpuOperator` | `true` | Indicated whether the dcgm-exporter was installed via gpu-operator or not |
| `kube-prometheus-stack.enabled` |  `true`  | Set to `false` when the cluster has an existing Prometheus installation that is __not based__ on the Prometheus __operator__. This setting requires Run:ai customer support |
| `kube-prometheus-stack.prometheusOperator.enabled` |  `true`  |  Set to `false` when the cluster has an existing Prometheus installation __based__ on the Prometheus __operator__ and Run:ai should use the existing one rather than install a new one | 
| `prometheus-adapter.enabled` | `false` | Install Prometheus Adapter. Used for Inference workloads using a custom metric for autoscaling. Set to `true` if __Prometheus Adapter__ is not already installed in the cluster |
| `prometheus-adapter.prometheus` | The address of the default Prometheus Service | If you installed your own custom Prometheus Service, set this field accordingly with `url` and `port` |


<!-- | `runai-operator.config.project-controller.createRoleBindings` | `true` | Set to `false` when using OpenShift. When set to false, will require an additional manual step when assigning users to Run:ai Projects |  -->

### Prometheus

The Run:ai Cluster installation uses [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/){target=_blank}. There are 3 alternative configurations:

1. Run:ai installs Prometheus (default).
2. Run:ai uses an existing Prometheus installation based on the Prometheus operator.
3. Run:ai uses an existing Prometheus installation based on a regular Prometheus installation.

For option 2, disable the flag `kube-prometheus-stack.prometheusOperator.enabled`. For option 3, please contact Run:ai Customer support. 

For options 2 and 3, if you enabled `prometheus-adapter`, please configure it as described in the Prometheus Adapter [documentation](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/97f23f1ff7ca62f33ab4dd339cc62addec7eccde/charts/prometheus-adapter/values.yaml#L34)


## Understanding Custom Access Roles

To review the access roles created by the Run:ai Cluster installation, see [Understanding Access Roles](../config/access-roles.md).

<!-- 
## Add a Proxy

Allow outbound internet connectivity in a proxied network environment. See [Installing Run:ai with an Internet Proxy Server](proxy-server.md). -->

## Manual Creation of Namespaces

Run:ai Projects are implemented as Kubernetes namespaces. By default, the administrator creates a new Project via the Administration user interface which then triggers the creation of a Kubernetes namespace named `runai-<PROJECT-NAME>`.
There are a couple of use cases that customers will want to disable this feature:

* Some organizations prefer to use their internal naming convention for Kubernetes namespaces, rather than Run:ai's default `runai-<PROJECT-NAME>` convention.
* Some organizations will not allow Run:ai to automatically create Kubernetes namespaces. 


Follow these steps to achieve this:

1. Disable the namespace creation functionality. See the  `runai-operator.config.project-controller.createNamespaces` flag above.
2. [Create a Project](../../../admin-ui-setup/project-setup/#create-a-new-project) using the Run:ai User Interface. 
3. Create the namespace if needed by running: `kubectl create ns <NAMESPACE>`. The suggested Run:ai default is `runai-<PROJECT-NAME>`.
4. Label the namespace to connect it to the Run:ai Project by running `kubectl label ns <NAMESPACE>  runai/queue=<PROJECT_NAME>`, where `<PROJECT_NAME>` is the name of the project you have created in the Run:ai user interface above and `<NAMESPACE>` is the name you chose for your namespace.


## RKE-Specific Setup

Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) requires additional steps:

### Certificate Signing Request (RKE1 only)

When creating a cluster on the Run:ai user interface:

* Download the "On Premise" Kubernetes type. 
* Edit the cluster values file and change `useCertManager` to `true` 

``` yaml  hl_lines="3"
init-ca:
    enabled: true
    useCertManager: true
```
<!-- During initialization, Run:ai creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) which needs to be approved by the cluster's Certificate Authority (CA). In RKE, this is not enabled by default, and the paths to your Certificate Authority's keypair must be referenced manually by adding the following parameters inside your cluster.yml file, under kube-controller:

``` YAML
services:
kube-controller:
    extra_args:
    cluster-signing-cert-file: /etc/kubernetes/ssl/kube-ca.pem
    cluster-signing-key-file: /etc/kubernetes/ssl/kube-ca-key.pem
```

For further information see [here](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/14674){target=_blank}. -->

On the cluster, install _Cert manager_ as follows:

``` bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set installCRDs=true
```

### NGINX (both RKE1 and RKE2)

RKE comes pre-installed with NGINX. Thus, the Run:ai prerequisite for ingress controller is not needed. 

### Researcher Authentication

See the RKE and RKE2 tabs in the [Researcher Authentication](../authentication/researcher-authentication.md#mandatory-kubernetes-configuration) document, on how to set up researcher authentication.
